Go to my avatar on Gitpod to check billing to confirm how much credit I have.

### Why Containerization?
Containerization is a type of virtualization in which all the components of an application are bundled into a single container image and can be run in isolated user space on the same shared operating system. Containers are lightweight, portable, and highly conducive to automation.


What is Docker hub?:
Docker Hub is a Docker Registry, a cloud-hosted version, open-source, scalable server-side application, and stateless. It can manage the sharing and storage of Docker images. Using Docker, developers can access it as public and create their own private repositories space and automate application build custom functions, work-groups, and webhooks.

Alternatives to Docker:

1. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

2. JFrog Artifactory.

3. Azure Container Registry.

4. Red Hat Quay.

5. Google Container Registry.

6. Harbor.

7. Nexus Repository Manager.

8. Sandboxie.

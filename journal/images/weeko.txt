FREE AWS cloud Project Boootcamp- Week0 Billing and Architecture
Overview of the boot camp:
Bootcamp happens every Saturday. Anything that doesn't get covered will be covered with an extra video
it is a 14 weeks boot camp(Andrew thinks more weeks may be added) insert dancing emoji
Focused on building a cloud workload
Each week builds off the other
There is homework
There is grading
There are digital badges
It is free
It is a bring your-own-account bootcamp(There may be spend however Chirag is helping to keep it at a minimal level)Thank you Chirag(smile)

What are we building:
A Cruddur App. A  disposable micro-blogging platform.

Tools for building:

SQL and No SQL databases
Realtime modern APis
Multiple containers services(*microservices)
A CI/CD pipeline
Decentralized Authentication and more

Week 0 Guest instructors:

- Margaret Valtierra (AWS Community hero)
- Chris Williams (AWS Community hero)


Project Scenario:
User Persona: Technical role play. This style of teaching will eventually help me think like my stakeholders 
First day of employment
No idea what I am building but I have heard interesting things to pique my interest also the pay is too good to leave on the table.
I know it's a start-up called Cruddur a microblogging site. [insert smiley] forgot to introduce myself - Jobina Arinze and I am a cloud Engineer.

Teams involved :
HR - Interviewer

Founder

Investors and Board of directors(They buy into the idea of the founder)

Fractional CTO- Someone partly committed to the company (They split their time between the startup and consulting in this case Andrew brown? smiley)

Marketing team: (Team will generate content)

Cruddur Users:
Yet to decide whether it going to be used by university students, or young professionals or to expand to other user types.
(This creates the issue of age authentication and generating age-appropriate content)
Short-lived content has to be engaging and exciting so that people keep coming back to the app.
Cruddur is an ephemeral micro-blogging platform. We have to build an app that creates a sense of community and trust in users
It is an expiring social media platform. Shares a lot of content but will not track the users long term.


Bear in mind:
It is expected that the content will be catchy and hopefully attract a lot of users and scale quickly. 
(This raises the issue of frequent authentication and things that need to work quickly without fail)
How to manage ephemeral content.
The app's selling point is its ephemeral nature. Creating a sense of community, leading to trust by its users 

What Cruddur has this week:
A domain name
An Aws Account (decisions on whether to use this account and start a fresh account) Thinking emoji 

Architecture: Projections, ORM(object-relational mapping) Monolithic Apps, Functional components or requirements.A good technical road map. Sprints and Agile methodology 
Do the work incrementally.
Microservice is advised please avoid monolithic.

Why AWS:
Foremost microservice provider and they are great at it.
 

Budget:
Keep spend as little as possible. This introduces us to the 
The iron triangle of Project management, 
![]() 
Essentially you get scope, cost, and time. You have to mostly choose two. (quick and cheap will sacrifice scope. Very expensive then you have to consider time)
The main thing is to find a way to balance all three of them. Also always the iron triangle concept in mind at the very start of every project.

Cruddur Requirements:
Frontend- Javascript using react 
Backend - Python using flask(python is the most popular language for cloud)
API- microservices avoid a monolith situation.



Architecting Solutions:
Crucial to the creation and functioning of the  Cruddur app is good architecture.
What is good architecture? In order to decipher what good architecture is we have to consider the following RRACs:
1. Requirements
2. Risk 
3. Assumptions
4. Constraints
Requirements are something the project must achieve at the end.
Requirements for Cruddur
1. Ephemeral
2. Looks like Twitter
requirements must be
- Verifiable
- Monitorable
- Traceable
- Feasible

Risk- Something that prevents your requirement from being successful
- SPOFs (Single points of failure)
- User commitment(Are users going to get hooked or not)
- Late delivery

Assumptions. Opinions we are holding as true at the planning and implementation stages
- Sufficient network bandwidth
- Stakeholders will be available
- Budget is approved 

Constraints are policy or technical limitations for the project
- Time (14+ weeks)
- Budget (zero budget spend we are leveraging on AWS free tier)
- Vendor selection

After considering RRACS we move to the actual designing 

Conceptual Design
  - created by business stakeholders and architects 
  - organizes and defines concepts and rules
  - napkin design

[insert cruddur napkin design]

This is the lowest level of design. It involves no technicalities. 


Logical Design- This is like the blueprint in which we are going to stand things on 
 - Defines how the system should be implemented
 - Enviroment without actual names or sizes
 - Example:undeployed CFT 

Physical Design. This the actual house that is built. (app) It is a fall out of the blue print
 - Representation of the actual thing that we are building
 - IP adresses, Ec2 instances everything is on the physical design
 
[physical design]

In order to acheive RRAC it is super important to develop a common dictionary. 
in developing a common dictionary we have to ask 'dumb question'. No assumptions be ready to always ask questions like
What are we trying to do?
How is it going to make money?
What kind of skillsets do we have available internally or are we going to outsource
How are we going to acheive this given the skillset available and the time frame provided.

Play be the packet when you play be the packet, you can see what you are building from your customers eyes, ie when they click on the url and enter the app,
do they get to be authenticated first. This just basically seeing the app from the users eyes.

TOGAF: What is TOGAF
"This is an architecture framework that provides the methods and tools for assisting in the acceptnce,
production,use and maintainance of an enterprise architecture. It is based on an iterative  process model supported by best practices
and a re-useable set of existing achitecture assets" It is acronym for Open Group Architecture Framework, is intended to to a standard way to design and implememnt 
architectures for very large computre systems.

- The most popular framework for architects
- Common dictionary of words to convey desired outcomes
- Meta model for creation of underlying projects
- Maps closely with AWS well architected framework

Closely related to TOGAF IS C4 model,which stands for connection,collaboration,communication and customers. The are
others, like Zachman, Dodaf etc. None is better than the other. They all help to break down complex architectures to the barest simplistic term.

AWS well-Architected framework
This is a tool provided by AWS. It gives you a compilation of questions that you can ask your team, investors etc. These questions are 
being asked from the 6 pillars of well architected framework which are 
Operational excellence
Security
Relability
Performance efficiency- How well is your system performing. How do you pick the best performimg architecture(are picking between Ec2 or going serverless)
Cost optimization - How do get the most value for money
Sustainability    - Company sustainability goals
Answering these set of questions will help to extract RRCA.



Billing:
You have to login as root user to view billing data. If you want the IAM user to have access to billing data you have have to grant permissions.
Pricing varies according to region
Billing on his dashboard had both his local currency and dollars mine did not.
I set up billing alarm
 

Security:
The CISO chief information security officer resonsible for an organiizations information and data security. 
I enabled MFA for the root user
I also enabled MFA for IAM user using google authenticator.
I Enabled Cloudtrail for auditing most API calls
There are three types of users IAM User, Human user, System user 
IAM user is a global service
IAM Roles- I AM roles manage who has permission to my resources on AWS
IAM policies - Controls their permission
Budgets:
Two budgets are free for the free tier.
I created a credit budget and a zero-spend budget. The zero spend is actually a $1 budget. It notifies you when your spend
exceeds $0.01. 
I Created thresholds for the budgets I created at 50%, 85%, and 100% of the actual budget.
![]()

Cloudshell:
Used cloud shell to generate credentials

Install AWS CLI:
The root user has MFA (picture)
Created a new user added the user to a group and granted the user full administrative access. (It is recommended that people are given just the permissions they need.)
Least privilege(Security best practice)
I used gitpod to download aws CLI for linux system with the following command

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

After downloading i ran:
`aws configure`
AWS access key ID:
AWS secret access key:
Default region Name: us-east-1
Default output format: json
These questions have to be answered correctly to configure Aws CLI correctly. After this, i ran sts-get-caller-identity
This command basically identifies the user.
ooops watched more of the video and this was the wrong thing to do.
To delete the configuration, i  had to run nano ~/.aws/config and nano ~/.aws/credentials.
yeepppee back in business so export credentials.
Checked variables on my gitpod profile to make sure my credntials were properly exported. Why export instaed of aws configure Andrew thinks that for the
pupose of the bootcamp................ I on the other hand learnt a new way of configuring my credentials.
![]()
I tried to push to main and had permission issues. I had not authorised gitpod to push to github
I logged into [here]https://gitpod.io/access-control/ and granted gitpod the required permission

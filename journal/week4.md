# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Database

A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured manner to allow for efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, including business, scientific research, and social media.

a database is a critical component of a backend system as it provides a reliable, secure, and scalable way to store and manage data. It helps to ensure data consistency and allows developers to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.

There are different types of databases, including:

- Relational databases: These are the most commonly used databases and store data in tables with rows and columns. They are based on the relational model of data, which allows for efficient querying and manipulation of data.

- NoSQL databases: These databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data. They do not use a traditional table-based schema and are often used in big data and real-time web applications.

- Object-oriented databases: These databases store data in objects rather than tables, making them useful for complex data structures and programming languages.

- Graph databases: These databases use graph structures to represent and store data, making them useful for applications that require complex relationships between data.

Document databases: These databases store data in documents, such as JSON or XML, making them useful for applications that require flexible and dynamic schemas.

### Postgresql

PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for data storage, processing, and retrieval in web applications. Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully-managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that supports several relational database engines, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL deployments in the cloud. It automates many common administrative tasks, such as backups, software patching, and database scaling, allowing users to focus on their applications. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL also provides options for high availability and read scaling, making it suitable for various use cases.

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is a high-performance, fully-managed database service that is compatible with PostgreSQL, and it provides better performance than standard PostgreSQL databases. It is designed to be highly available, durable, and fault-tolerant, and it automatically scales up or down based on the application's needs.

To deploy PostgreSQL on AWS, users can choose between Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, depending on their specific requirements. Both services offer various benefits and features that can help users to manage their PostgreSQL databases in the cloud effectively.

## Provision RDS Instance
On the Cli run run the following commands. Kindly note that for region, you have to specify the alphabet associated with the region.
My region in this case is us-east-1a

```
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier cruddur-db-instance \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version  14.6 \
  --master-username cruddurroot \
  --master-user-password <enter password min 8 characters> \
  --allocated-storage 20 \
  --availability-zone us-east-1a \
  --backup-retention-period 0 \
  --port 5432 \
  --no-multi-az \
  --db-name cruddur \
  --storage-type gp2 \
  --publicly-accessible \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --enable-performance-insights \
  --performance-insights-retention-period 7 \
  --no-deletion-protection
  
  ```

This command should return back json

Go to AWS RDS and check for database

Click into database, and click on actions.  I am shutting it down temporarily. This is beacause i do not have immediate use for it.

### PSQL Common commands

```

\x on -- expanded display when looking at data
\q -- Quit PSQL
\l -- List all databases
\c database_name -- Connect to a specific database
\dt -- List all tables in the current database
\d table_name -- Describe a specific table
\du -- List all users and their roles
\dn -- List all schemas in the current database
CREATE DATABASE database_name; -- Create a new database
DROP DATABASE database_name; -- Delete a database
CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype1, column2 datatype2, ...); -- Create a new table
DROP TABLE table_name; -- Delete a table
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition; -- Select data from a table
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...); -- Insert data into a table
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition; -- Update data in a table
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; -- Delete data from a table

```

To test connection to postgres on the terminal

```
psql -Upostgres --host localhost

```

`\l ` List all databases
